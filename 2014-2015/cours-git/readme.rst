**The merge of convenience and cool!**

Hovercraft-t2t is a tool to make impress.js_ presentations from
txt2tags. For a quick explanation, see the demo_.


Features
========


- Write your presentations in a text markup language. No slow, limiting GUI, no annoying HTML!

- Pan, rotate and zoom in 3D, with automatic repositioning of slides!

- A presenter console with notes and slide previews!

- The slide show generated is in HTML, so you only need a web browser to show it.

- Easy sharing, as it can be put up on a website for anyone to see!


Limitations
===========


- presentations can only use moving slides. No "dissolve" effect yet.
- can't display bullets in lists one by one, like in traditional presentations.
- unlike reveal.js, doesn't seem to display well on smartphones or tablets.


Installation
============

Hovercraft_ requires Python 3.2 or later, and can be installed like any Python package. Txt2tags_ requires Python 2.6

The easiest way is to install pip_, and then run:

::

  pip install hovercraft

Hovercraft is untested on Windows, but there is no reason it shouldn't work, at least in theory.
